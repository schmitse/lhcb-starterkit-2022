# lhcb-starterkit-2022

This repo contains a tutorial for the [zfit](https://github.com/zfit/zfit) and [Minuit](https://iminuit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) libraries for parameter estimation in python that was created for the LHCb starterkit 2022. 

## Virtual environment

The notebook was created having `python 3.9` in mind with zfit version `0.10.1` and Minuit `2.17.0`.
Additionally required are the dependencies of the packages, such as tensorflow, and numpy. 
The way i recommend to set up a virtual environment for python is with [miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) or [micromamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/micromamba.html).
